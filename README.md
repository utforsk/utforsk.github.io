Welcome to **utforsk** — a collection of small (and occasionally brilliant) AI-generated tools, experiments, and ideas.  
Some are playful. Some are useful. Some are... questionable. But all of them exist because AI made it effortless.

This space exists to explore what happens when ideas don’t get stuck in the “not worth the time” pile.  
Because now, they don’t take time — they just take a prompt.

## What lives here?

- Learning tools (like a clock game to teach kids time — with humor, challenge, and innovation)
- Interactive visualizations
- Tiny web apps
- Utilities, widgets, experiments, who-knows-what
- All things you probably wouldn't code manually, but are totally worth having

## Ethics, kind of

Yes, this README was written by an AI too.  
But more importantly: AI can and **should** be used for good. Not to replace people, but to help us create the things  
we never would’ve built ourselves — the kind that help others, teach something new, or just bring joy.

Use AI with intent. Use it where you wouldn’t have otherwise created anything at all.  
That’s when it feels like magic **with a clean conscience**.

## Made by humans, kind of

Everything here was built with:
- ✍️ A human idea
- ⚙️ An AI implementation
- ✅ A quick sanity-check (usually)

> “utforsk” is Norwegian for “explore” — because that’s what this is all about.

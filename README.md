Welcome to **utforsk** — a collection of small (and occasionally brilliant) AI-generated tools, experiments, and ideas.  
Some are playful. Some are useful. Some are... questionable. But all of them exist because AI made it effortless.

This space exists to explore what happens when ideas don’t get stuck in the “not worth the time” pile.  
Because now, they don’t take time — they just take a prompt.

## What lives here?

- Learning tools (like a clock game to teach kids time — with humor, challenge, and innovation)
- Interactive visualizations
- Tiny web apps
- Utilities, widgets, experiments, who-knows-what
- All things you probably wouldn't code manually, but are totally worth having

## Ethics, kind of

Yes, this README was written by an AI too.  
But more importantly: AI can and **should** be used for good. Not to replace people, but to help us create the things  
we never would’ve built ourselves — the kind that help others, teach something new, or just bring joy.

Use AI with intent. Use it where you wouldn’t have otherwise created anything at all.  
That’s when it feels like magic **with a clean conscience**.

## Made by humans, kind of

Everything here was built with:
- ✍️ A human idea
- ⚙️ An AI implementation
- ✅ A quick sanity-check (usually)

> “utforsk” is Norwegian for “explore” — because that’s what this is all about.

A simple and elegant tool to quickly clean and transform text directly in your browser.  
Perfect for developers, writers, and anyone who needs to tidy up text snippets without a full-fledged editor.

- 🧼 **Live Transformation:** See your cleaned text update in real-time as you type.
- 🧩 **Modular Filters:** Easily toggle cleaning modules like trimming whitespace or replacing special characters.
- ✨ **Character Visualization:** An optional mode to highlight special characters like tabs, non-breaking spaces, and em-dashes.
- ↔️ **Resizable Panes:** Adjust the input and output panels to your liking with a draggable splitter.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.
- 🌐 **Browser-based** - no installation required.

### [`ip6-what`](https://utforsk.github.io/ip6-what)

> ✅ **Status: Available**
> Try it now at [utforsk.github.io/ip6-what](https://utforsk.github.io/ip6-what)
> 💬 Found a bug or have an idea? [Create an issue](https://github.com/utforsk/utforsk.github.io/issues/new?title=[ip6-what]%20Issue%3A%20&labels=ip6-what)

A comprehensive IPv6 address analyzer, subnet calculator, and reference guide.
Designed to demystify IPv6 addresses, multicast scopes, and special prefixes for network engineers and learners.

- 🔍 **Deep Analysis:** Break down any IPv6 address into its components (subnet, interface ID, flags, scope).
- 📚 **Extensive Reference:** Built-in knowledge base of hundreds of special-purpose addresses, multicast groups, and RFCs.
- 🛠️ **Subnet Calculator:** Visualize subnet capacity and breakdowns (e.g., how many /64s fit in a /48).
- 📡 **Multicast Decoder:** Instantly identify multicast scope, flags (Transient, Rendezvous, etc.), and well-known group IDs.
- 📱 **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on desktop (with pinned reference sidebar) and mobile.

More projects will be added here as ideas escape from the prompt buffer.
